A - introduction to what we have. intro to the very basics of Emotion (jsx, css).

B - Button is a bit hard to read... let's change that font!! (intro to <Global>)

C - Ok cool, let's get this button to work! Create a WordDiv. make it look cool.

D - dynamic time!! make it change on hover state.

E - what about something more difficult? EmotionDiv! let's create dynamic contrasting colors.

F - ok great... now let's add in a slider to let us change the size of the EmotionDivs.
    (do this as a separate CSS object that is passed into the css={} in an array)

G - do we have any more time? let's make it an x-y slider, where the y controls rotation speed.
